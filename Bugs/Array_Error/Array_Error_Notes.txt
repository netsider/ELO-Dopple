// Bugs:
// Quotation marks are automatically being put in the value of the value field on HTML buttons.
// Serialize/unserialize messes up because of that, and so does json_encode/decode.

// Have to find alternative way, because this is bullshit
// Any alternative way will be the same as the old way -- Sending both values and then parsing it out later, since both players need to be sent through to calculate winner/loser scores.  No idea.  No solution found after 2 nights.
// https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14071587/php-pass-array-through-post - I guess hidden fields are the only way.  Use hidden field to contain both players and then sort upon POST request.  This is retarded, since hidden fields can be altered.

I ended up using base64 encoding AFTER Json encoding it (POST doesn't like JSON encode or serialize?).  I also turned both values into strings (one was a number) in case they weren't already (just so nothing messes up in the future or in case wierd values are passed through by me).
